description: Teleport database access introduction, demo and resources.

Teleport can provide secure connections to your databases while improving both
access control and visibility.

Some of the things you can do with database access:

- Enable users to retrieve short-lived database certificates using a Single Sign-On
  flow, thus maintaining their organization-wide identity.
- Configure role-based access controls for databases and implement custom
  [Access Request](../access-controls/access-requests.mdx) workflows.
- Capture database activity in the Teleport audit log.

## Demo

Let's connect to a PostgreSQL server with `psql` and pgAdmin 4 after authenticating
with GitHub, execute a few SQL queries and observe them in the audit log:

## Protecting your database

The following guides show you how to protect a specific database with Teleport.

(!docs/pages/includes/database-access/guides.mdx!)

We plan to support more databases in the future based on customer demand.  See
if the database you're interested in has already been requested among [GitHub
issues](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/labels/database-access) or
open a [new issue](https://github.com/gravitational/teleport/issues/new/choose)
to register your interest.

## Supported database clients

Teleport relies on client certificates for authentication, so any database
client that supports this method of authentication and uses modern TLS (1.2+)
should work.

Standard command-line clients such as `psql`, `mysql`, `mongo` or `mongosh` are
supported. There are also instructions for configuring select
[graphical clients](../connect-your-client/gui-clients.mdx).

## Resources

To learn more about configuring role-based access control for database access,
check out the [RBAC](./rbac.mdx) section.

The [Architecture](./architecture.mdx) section provides a more in-depth look at
Teleport Database Service internals such as networking and security.

See [Reference](./reference.mdx) for an overview of
database access-related configuration and CLI commands.
